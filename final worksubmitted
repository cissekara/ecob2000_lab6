#Note that they give data on age as “TBIRTH_YEAR” so if you put that into a regression, the coefficient sign swaps from what we usually think of, if we had AGE in the regression. Could define AGE <- 2021 - TBIRTH_YEAR. A regression, Y ~ AGE might have a positive coefficient on Age, that as person gets older Y tends to increase. It would then have a negative coefficient on TBIRTH_YEAR, that as person’s birth year goes up (therefore they are younger) then Y tends to decrease.

#We did not see much difference between the Logit function and Probit Function. Conclusion: the coefficients signs of Logit model and Probit model are the same. Both models demonstrate that “HighSchool” is insignificant.
#Overall we have notice that Black females with Some HS credits is very interesting. The level of education in relatiosnhip with the decision to be vaccunated is not significant in both scenarios with logit and probit comparisons
